## Guidelines ##
Disabled buttons have poor contrast and can confuse some users, so avoid them if possible.
Only use disabled buttons if research shows it makes the user interface easier to understand.

Secondary buttons should be avoided when possible.
Some users can find confusing the differences between primary and seconday buttons.
In general we recommend using only one call to action on a page, styled as our green button.

## To do ##
- Mobile styling, buttons should be full witch for mobile layout.
- Accessibilit fix, disable buttons have a low colour contrast ratio.
